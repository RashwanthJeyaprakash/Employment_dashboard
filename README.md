## Data Preparation Snapshots

Before building the dashboards, I prepared the data by:

- Adding helper columns for slicing/filtering

## Key Findings

**CASE**: A User wants to work in the business service sector. They can navigates the dashboard using the slicer and button to filter results, focusing on a specific sector. 

Through the dashboard, they can
- Instantly view top-paying states for that sector
- Identify  states that have the most job opportunities
- compare multiple sectors or locations for better decision making.
