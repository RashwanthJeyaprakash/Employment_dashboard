# Key Findings

**CASE**: An User wants to work in the business service sector. He navigates the dashboard using the slicer and button to filter results, focusing on business services. 

Using the dashboard, he can
- Instantly view top-paying states for that sector
- Identify which states have the most job opportunities
- Drill down to compare multiple sectors or locations
